        <p>
            I created this map to supplement my resume and cover letter. I believe with my experience and travel it can be a great way to showcase my skills and knowledge.
            </br> My life has been mapped out to gain the most experience I can. I love exploring and learning new skills, getting out of my comfort zone is a way to learn about myself and to explore alternate ways of achieving goals.

        <h3>Connecticut</h3>
        <p> 
                I grew up in Connecticut and graduated from the University of New Haven (UNH) with a Bachelors of Fire Science. During my coursework, I was fascinated by all the different realms of the fire industry. I volunteered at numerous local departments, interned with the Fire Marshalls office, installed and designed fire suppression systems, received my EMT.

        <h3>Navy</h3>
        <p>I joined the United States Navy out of High School.
                During my service, I was stationed all along the East Coast mainly out of Florida. I also did two tours in the Middle East working alongside Third County Nationals providing base support
                 and operations. During my deployments, I would work with the contracted fire crews and was intrigued by their profession. 
                 After my enlistment, I returned to Connecticut to study Fire Science at the University of New Haven.

        <h3>Hawaii</h3>
        <p>After college, I moved to The Big Island of Hawai ªi. I worked at SolarCity, designing and installing residential solar panels. I have always been drawn to things spatially, but working at SolarCity made me think about it in an alternate way. I could relate my interests for, location, geography, and maps all in a work environment.
            </br>Before each job, we would calculate the amount of energy needed, map out the areas with the highest solar irradiance (which varied widely throughout the island), we would then draw out maps placing each panel around any obstacles on the mounting surface. Once on site, I would sketch out the layout on the structure to ensure proper fit and alignment and then install. 
           </br> In my off time, I would traverse the whole island to soak in its geographical beauty, I became so interested in the different features of the island I started mapping the remote locations to help the community. There is no other place like Hawaii!

        <h3>Colorado</h3>
        <p>Once I made the move to Colorado I dedicated my time to learning new skills. I enrolled in a dev bootcamp in Boulder to learn web development. This decision has set my skills to a greater level, and has made me eager to keep learning. Once I graduated from the development courses I continued to further my skills and grasp the spatial side of things. 
            I contracted through CBI Engineering for the City of Denver, where I was part of a small team to map out and collect street light data for the entire county. </br><b>Technologies Used:</b> ArcGIS Collector, ArcMap, QGIS, ArcGIS SDE, FME.
        </br></br>After CBI, I was hired on at Frontier where I now work as Database Administrator, and GIS Analyst. I design and create Postgres Databases, create workflows for fellow analyst to use, help develop a  (desktop) analysis web tool for clients to have control of live data while viewing it on webmap. 
            </br><b>Technologies Used:</b> PostgreSQL\PostGIS, FME, QGIS, ArcGIS, GDAL(OGR), GeoServer, Alteryx, NodeJS, Oracle, MapBox, MyWorld by UbiSense, Leaflet, TurfJS, Google Cloud SQL and Compute, Heroku, AWS.

        <h3>Open Source Technologies</h3>
        <p>While I am extremely capable and confident using paid for software like ArcMap, I take pride in learning and developing with open source technologies like Postgres, Mapbox and QGIS. With just this stack alone, I believe that I can rival anything that costly software can produce and most of the time with quicker results, all for the cost of 0 Dollars! </p>
