                I created this map to supplement my resume and cover letter. I believe with my experience and travel it can be a great way
                to showcase my skills and knowledge.
                </br><br> My life has been mapped out to gain the most experience I can. I love exploring and learning new skills,
                getting out of my comfort zone is a way to learn about myself and to explore alternate ways of achieving
                goals.

            <h3>Connecticut</h3>
            <p>
                I was born and raised in Connecticut. I graduated from the University of New Haven (UNH) with a Bachelor's of Fire Science. During my
                coursework, I was fascinated by all the different realms of the fire industry: I volunteered for a number of
                local fire departments, I completed an internship with the Fire Marshall's office, installed and designed fire suppression systems, and earned my EMT.

            <h3>Navy</h3>
            <p>I joined the United States Navy out of high school. Throughout my service I was stationed along the East Coast
              predominently in Florida. I completed two tours in the Middle East working alongside Third County Nationals providing
                base support and operations. During each deployment, I worked with the contracted fire crews and gained a strong interest in the profession. I was inspired to pursue a career in the fire service, so following my enlistment I returned to Connecticut to study Fire Science at the University of New Haven.

            <h3>Hawaii</h3>
            <p>After earning my bachelor's degree, I moved to The Big Island of Hawai ªi. I worked for SolarCity, designing and installing residential
                solar panels. I have always been drawn to things spatially, but working at SolarCity made me think about
                it in an alternate way. I could relate my interests for location, geography, and maps all in a work environment.
                </br></br>Before each job, we would calculate the amount of energy needed, map out the areas with the highest
                solar irradiance (which varied widely throughout the island). We would then draw out maps placing each panel
                around any obstacles on the mounting surface. Once my team would arrive to the site of the job, I would sketch out the layout on the structure
                to ensure proper fit and alignment to complete the installation.
                </br></br> During my free time, I would traverse the whole island to soak in its geographical beauty, I became so interested
                in the different features of the island I started mapping the remote locations to help the community. There
                is no other place like Hawaii!

            <h3>Colorado</h3>
            <p>Once I made the move to Colorado I dedicated my time to learning new skills. I enrolled in a development bootcamp in
                Boulder to learn web development. This decision has set my skills to a greater level, and has made me eager
                to keep learning. Once I graduated from the development courses I continued to further my skills and grasp
                the spatial side of things. I contracted through CBI Engineering for the City of Denver, where I was part
                of a small team to map out and collect street light data for the entire county. </br>
                <b>Technologies Used:</b> ArcGIS Collector, ArcMap, QGIS, ArcGIS SDE, FME.
                </br>
                </br>After CBI, I was hired on at Frontier where I now work as Database Administrator, and GIS Analyst. I design
                and create Postgres Databases, create workflows for fellow analyst to use, help develop a (desktop) analysis
                web tool for clients to have control of live data while viewing it on webmap.
                </br>
                <b>Technologies Used:</b> PostgreSQL\PostGIS, FME, QGIS, ArcGIS, GDAL(OGR), GeoServer, Alteryx, NodeJS, Oracle,
                MapBox, MyWorld by UbiSense, Leaflet, TurfJS, Google Cloud SQL and Compute, Heroku, AWS.

            <h3>Open Source Technologies</h3>
            <p>While I am extremely capable and confident using paid for software like ArcMap, I take pride in learning and
                developing with open source technologies like Postgres, Mapbox and QGIS. With just this stack alone, I believe
                that I can rival anything that costly software can produce and most of the time with quicker results. As open source software is mainly free of charge there are multiple other benefits, including quicker bug fixes, a developer community and above all freedom of choice on which technologies to integrate with. </p>
