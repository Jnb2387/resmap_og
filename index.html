        <h3>Connecticut</h3>
        <p> I grew up in Connecticut, and graduated from the University of New Haven (UNH) with a Bachelors of Fire Science. During my course work I was fascinated by the all the different realms of
            the fire industry. I volunteered on numerous local departments, interned with the Fire Marshalls office, installed and designed fire suppression systems, received my EMT,
            but I always was especially intrigued by wildland fires.

        <h3>Navy</h3>
        <p>I joined the United States Navy right out of High School in 2005<br>
        During my service I was stationed all along the East Coast mainly out of Florida. I also did two tours in the Middle East working along side Third County Nationals providing base support
         and operations. During my deployments I would work hand and hand with the contracted fire crews and became intrigued in their profession. 
         After my enlistment I returned to Connecticut to study Fire Science at the UNH.
