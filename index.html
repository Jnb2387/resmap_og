        <h1 id="myname">Jeffrey Bradley</h1>
        <p>I created this map in supplement to my resume and coverletter. I believe with all my experience and travel it can be a great way to showcase my skills and knowledge. 
         My life has been mapped out to gain the most experience I can. I love exploring and learning new skills, getting out of my comfort zone is a way to learn about myself and to explore alternate ways about achieving goals.

        <h3>Connecticut</h3>
        <p> I grew up in Connecticut, and graduated from the University of New Haven (UNH) with a Bachelors of Fire Science. During my course work I was fascinated by the all the different realms of
            the fire industry. I volunteered on numerous local departments, interned with the Fire Marshalls office, installed and designed fire suppression systems, received my EMT.

        <h3>Navy</h3>
        <p>I joined the United States Navy right out of High School<br>
        During my service I was stationed all along the East Coast mainly out of Florida. I also did two tours in the Middle East working along side Third County Nationals providing base support
         and operations. During my deployments I would work hand and hand with the contracted fire crews and became intrigued in their profession. 
         After my enlistment I returned to Connecticut to study Fire Science at the University of New Haven.

        <h3>Hawaii</h3>
        <p>After college I moved to The Big Island on Hawaii. I worked at SolarCity, designing and installing residential solar panels. This was my start to developing my spatial thought process. Before each job, I would calculate the solar irradiance, which varied widely throughout the island. Once on site I would map the layout on the structure to ensure proper fit and alignment and then install.  In my off time I would traverse the whole island to soak in its geographical beauty, and map the remote locations to help the community. There is no other place like Hawaii!

        <h3>Colorado</h3>
        <p>Once I made the move to Colorado I dedicated my time to learning new skills. I enrolled in a dev bootcamp in Boulder to learn web development. This decision has set my skills to a greater level, and has made me eager to keep learning. Once I graduated from the development courses I continued to further my skills and grasp the spatial side of things. 
            I contracted through CBI Engineering for the City of Denver, where I was part of a small team to map out and collect street light data for the entire county. We used technologies like ArcGIS Collector, ArcMap, QGIS, ArcGIS SDE, FME.
            After CBI, I was hired on at Frontier where I work as Database Administrator, and GIS Analyst. 
            I design and create Postgres Databases, Create workflows for fellow Analyst to use, develop a desktop analysis web interface for the client to have complete control of live data and view it on webmap. 
            Technologies Used: PostgreSQL\PostGIS, FME, QGIS, ArcGIS, GDAL(OGR), GeoServer, Alteryx, NodeJS, Oracle, MapBox, MyWorld by UbiSense, TurfJS, Google Cloud SQL and Compute, Heroku, AWS.

        <h3>Open Source Technologies</h3>
        <p>While I am extremely capable and confident using paid for software like ArcMap, I take pride in learning and developing with open source technologies like Postgres, Mapbox and QGIS. With just this stack alone, I believe that I can rival anything that costly software can produce and most of the time with quicker results, all for the cost of 0 Dollars! </p>
